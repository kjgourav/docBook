          <h3>Who We Are</h3>
          <p>
            Our platform is designed to bridge the gap between patients and healthcare professionals. With a simple and intuitive interface, patients can schedule appointments, view doctor profiles, and access their medical history securely.
          </p>
          <p>
            Doctors can manage their schedules and keep track of patient consultations, while administrators ensure smooth coordination across departments. We believe technology can empower better health outcomes &mdash; and we&#39;re building just that.
          </p>
          <p>We are all in 2024!</p>
          <p>We are working on a MERN STACK PROJECT.</p>
          <p>
            Coding is not just what we do, it&#39;s what we love. This project reflects our commitment to using code to solve real-world problems and make healthcare more accessible and efficient.
          </p>
          <p>Stay tuned, we&#39;re just getting started!</p>
